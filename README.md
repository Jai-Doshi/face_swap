• Develop a Python application for automatic face swapping in images and videos.

• Utilize OpenCV and dlib libraries for face detection, alignment, and swapping.

• Features include face detection, alignment, and an accurate swapping algorithm.

• Workflow involves loading input media, detecting and aligning faces, performing face swapping while preserving expressions, and saving the output.

• Challenges include accurate detection and alignment, natural blending of swapped faces, and handling variations in lighting and expressions.

• Extensions include real-time face swapping, face swapping in videos, and exploring advanced facial attribute manipulation.
